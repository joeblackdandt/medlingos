# Medlingos - Project for Mangohacks2019
This is about to create a simplified experience between patients and healthcare professionals to increase access and healthcare quality by overcoming the current limitations set by cultural barriers, specifically (and hopefully not limited to) language barriers.

Proposed solution is patient-centered, therefore the patient is the one that starts the interaction. 

The app would be used when a patient seeks medical attention, but feels limited by his communication skills. Through a series of Q & A, the app should create a sort of quick reference profile that will be used to:
* First, recommend the patient to visit a specific medical facility based on location, multilanguage friendly, maybe healthcare provider, and current condition based somehow on the quick survey.
* Second, intake information from the patient and create a translation to provide to the healthcare facility so they can select the most adequate healthcare professional.
* Third, provide both the patient and the professional some additional communication tools (situation related keywords, etc.) that might help when they interact.

##### Issues:
•	Patients not getting medical attention because they don’t know how to traverse the healthcare system in the US, especially when they face cultural limitations such as language.

##### Purpose:
•	To connect a non-english speaking patient with the appropriate healthcare professional.
